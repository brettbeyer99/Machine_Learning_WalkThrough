# Daily Machine Learning Algorithm Implementation

The following is a walkthrough to implement a variety of machine learning algorithms from scratch. You can track your progress by checking the boxes when you've completed each algorithm. The daily schedule is tentative, and you're free to go through the walkthrough at your own pace and in any order.

I've provided solutions for the algorithms, but I encourage you to fork the repository and try coding each algorithm yourself!

## Instructions
- [ ] Start with Day 1 and work your way down the list.
- [X] Once you've completed an algorithm, simply check it off by replacing the `[ ]` with `[x]`.
