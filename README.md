# Daily Machine Learning Algorithm Implementation

Welcome to your daily machine learning algorithm challenge! The goal is to implement one machine learning algorithm from scratch each day. This README file serves as a progress tracker, where you can check off each algorithm once it's completed.

## Instructions
- [ ] Start with Day 1 and work your way down the list.
- [X] Once you've completed an algorithm, simply check it off by replacing the `[ ]` with `[x]`.

## How to Check Off an Algorithm
- To mark an algorithm as complete, replace `[ ]` with `[x]` next to the algorithm's name.
- Example:
  - `[x] Day 1: Logistic Regression` (indicates Logistic Regression is completed).

## Notes
- Feel free to document your learnings or challenges faced for each algorithm below its name for future reference.
- Adjust the plan as needed based on your progress.

Good luck, and happy coding!
